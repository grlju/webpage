This is a package for calculating multimarket contact.

It consists of seven measures: Baum & Korn (1999), Chen (1996), Baum & Korn (1999), Count, Feinberg (1985), Boeker, Goodstein, Stephan, & Murmann,(1997), Baum & Korn (1996), and Evans & Kessides (1994).

The measures closely follow the definitions used in Gimeno, J. and Jeong, E. (2001), "Multimarket contact: meaning and measurement at multiple levels of analysis", in Baum, J.A.C. and Greve, H.R. (Ed.) Multiunit Organization and Multimarket Strategy (Advances in Strategic Management, Vol. 18), Emerald Group Publishing Limited, Bingley, pp. 357-408. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0742-3322(01)18013-7
